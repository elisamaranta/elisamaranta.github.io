Iâ€™m a PhD student conducting an [Environmental Research DTP](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford and the [Calleva Centre for Evolution and Human Science](https://callevacentre.org/). 

My PhD will investigate evolutionary responses in insects to anthropogenic pressures. The project is part of a larger project led by Professor Tim Barraclough exploring evolutionary design principles for sustainable genetic control of crop diseases. Current approaches for managing crop pests and diseases tend to be ineffective and unsustainable, largely due to the rapid emergence of resistance in pest and disease-causing species. At the same time, many insect species are reported to be declining globally due to human-driven environmental change leading to potential ecosystem disruptions. The aim of my PhD is to assess which ecological and genetic traits contribute to evolutionary resilience, predisposing some insects to rapid evolution and others to decline. 

Before joining Oxford, I completed a MSc in [Ecology, Evolution and Systematics](https://ees.bio.lmu.de/) at LMU, Munich. This was possible thanks to a generous [Leverhulme Trust Study Abroad Scholarship](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/). My master's thesis focused on intraspecific sensory variation in _Heliconius_ butterflies, its genetic basis and potential role during ecological speciation. This work was completed as part of Profesor Richard Merrill's Behaviour & Speciation group.
